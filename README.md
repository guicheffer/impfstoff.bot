# 💉 impfstoff.bot

Bot for telegram and twitter (for now) to fetch vaccine appointments in Berlin (and, in the future, other cities).

## What?

- Telegram: [@impfstoffBot](http://telegram.me/impfstoffBot)
- Twitter: [@impfstoffBot](https://twitter.com/impfstoffBot)

## Contribute

Hey you, there are a few ways you may contribute with the bot! I appreciate your interest in advance, whatever it is! 💖

Since there is involved costs in aws machines and efforts around an open-source project in GitHub (link at the bottom), the options are:

- 💰 Use PayPal for whatever amount you wish: https://paypal.me/guicheffer
- 🍺 Buy me a beer: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/guicheffer
- ❗️ Open issues and pull requests in our Repo here: https://github.com/guicheffer/impfstoff.bot

I am happy to help you finding vaccine slots and we'll be definitely adding new features and fixes into this and the twitter bot. I appreciate your help! ❤️
